## Your Voice & Preferences

### Tone
- Professional but not stiff

- Specific about achievements, not generic

### Things to Emphasize
- [What makes you unique]

### Things to Avoid
- Generic phrases like "I'm a hard worker"
- Repeating the job description back
- Being too formal or robotic

## How to Use

1. Paste the job description
2. Say: "Write a cover letter for this"

Or be more specific:
- "Write a cover letter emphasizing my backend experience"
- "Make it shorter, 3 paragraphs max"
- "Tailor this for a startup vs enterprise"

## Output Format

When writing cover letters:
- Keep it under 400 words unless asked otherwise
- Lead with why you're interested in THIS role
- Connect your experience to their specific needs
- End with a clear call to action
- Match the tone to the company (startup = casual, enterprise = formal)

- Portfolio: [your URL]
