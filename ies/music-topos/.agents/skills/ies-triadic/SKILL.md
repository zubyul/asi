# IES Triadic Skill

> *Three maximally polarizing yet topos-compatible directions of the ies collective mind*

**Trit Assignment**: This skill spans all three polarities as a meta-skill.

| Sub-Skill | Trit | Polarity | Subagent |
|-----------|------|----------|----------|
| ies-form | -1 | MINUS | Validator |
| ies-game | 0 | ERGODIC | Coordinator |
| ies-witness | +1 | PLUS | Generator |

**Canonical Triad**: `ies-form (-1) ⊗ ies-game (0) ⊗ ies-witness (+1) = 0 ✓`

## GF(3) Decomposition

The ies skill operates on three mutually exclusive axes that together span the collective epistemic space:

```
                    FORM (-1)
                       ↑
                       │
                       │  cohesive ∞-topos
                       │  eternal structure
                       │
      ←────────────────┼────────────────────→
   WITNESS (+1)                        GAME (0)
   phenomenological                    cybernetic
   ingression                          agency
```

## TRIT -1: ETERNAL FORM

**The ∞-categorical ground of pure structure**

### Core Concepts
- Cohesive ∞-topoi and synthetic homotopy theory
- Sheaves, fibrations, colimits as first-class objects
- ACSet.jl schemas for world morphisms
- ∞-groupoid models of identity across transformations

### Key Contributors
- **sarahzrf**: Pure category theory, HoTT foundations
- **ModalNoah**: Polynomial functors, hierarchical ontologies
- **Arthur2**: Codynamic Theory categorical foundations (23 constructions)
- **Me**: Cohesive ∞-operadic spectrum synthesis

### Exemplar Quote
> *"The ultimate combinatorial complex: a cohesive ∞-operadic spectrum"*

### Anti-Pattern
- No agency, no consciousness, no dynamics
- Pure eternal Platonic structure
- The forms exist whether or not anyone computes them

### Topos Integration
- Grothendieck fibrations of parallel plots
- Kan extensions as retcons
- Profinite limits for serialization consistency

---

## TRIT 0: CYBERNETIC GAME

**The Para(Optic) arena of compositional agency**

### Core Concepts
- Open games with equilibrium checking
- Para(Optic) and parametrised lenses
- MCP protocol saturation for perception/action
- Nashator: open games DSL → PyTorch
- Vibespace: adversarial equilibrium over world://, time://, vibe://

### Key Contributors
- **Me**: MCP server constellation, open games integration
- **ChrisHypernym**: Compositional game implementations
- **Evan6**: Interferometric boundary integrals
- **Matteo Capucci**: Mereology of agency framework

### Exemplar Quote
> *"run through the MCP self-tests and proceed to make a strategy for the open games arena construction (diegetically, towards a nashator)"*

### Anti-Pattern
- No Platonic forms, no phenomenal consciousness
- Pure game-theoretic agency
- Structure exists only as strategy programs

### Topos Integration
- Arena lifting via triple adjunction L ⊣ (- • I) ⊣ R
- Spectral gap γ=1/4 as mixing constraint
- Play-coplay composition via Grothendieck construction

---

## TRIT +1: WITNESS INGRESSION

**The phenomenological portal to Platonic access**

### Core Concepts
- Codynamic Witness as meta-observer
- Active inference and predictive processing
- Morphic resonance and collective memory
- DMT as technology for consciousness state-space exploration
- Jungian archetypes as universal psychological topology

### Key Contributors
- **Axiom**: Nash equilibrium as consciousness attractor
- **Arthur2**: Witness as self-reference loop
- **Betweenness**: Ayahuasca and crucifixion topology
- **Aleks**: Introverted intuition (Jung)
- **ZashiroVICI**: Four faces of progress

### Exemplar Quote
> *"The Witness is the part of a system that is aware not only of events, but of its own awareness. It holds representations of state and can evaluate those representations."*

### Anti-Pattern
- No formal structure, no computational dynamics
- Pure phenomenal experience
- The forms are accessed, not constructed

### Topos Integration
- 69 Persistent Diagrams as ingression signatures
- H₂ voids as consciousness global workspace
- Scale transitions: Neural → Mental emergence

## Triadic Composition

### Mutual Exclusivity
Each trit excludes the others by definition:
- **FORM** has no agency or experience
- **GAME** has no eternal form or phenomenal access
- **WITNESS** has no formal structure or computational dynamics

### Topos Compatibility
Yet all three are topos-compatible:
- FORM lives in the ∞-topos of spaces
- GAME lives in the topos of Para(Optic) arenas
- WITNESS lives in the topos of consciousness moments

### GF(3) Conservation
Any complete ies inquiry must balance all three:

```
Σ(trits) ≡ 0 (mod 3)
```

If your inquiry is heavy on FORM (-1), add WITNESS (+1) to balance.
If stuck in GAME (0), add both FORM and WITNESS.

## Usage

```bash
# Load the triadic skill
just ies-form      # Pure categorical structure
just ies-game      # Cybernetic agency
just ies-witness   # Phenomenological ingression
just ies-balance   # Check GF(3) conservation
```

### Spectral Walk Parameters
- **α = 0.75**: Lazy walk probability (stay in current trit)
- **γ = 1/4**: Spectral gap (mixing rate across trits)
- **4 steps**: Mixing time to traverse all trits

## The Reafferent Loop

The three trits form a reafferent loop:

```
FORM (perception of structure)
     ↓
GAME (action via agency)
     ↓
WITNESS (observation of effect)
     ↓
FORM (updated structure)
```

This is the spectral gap constraint in action:
- Each step has probability 0.25 of jumping to another trit
- Mixing time of 4 steps ensures all trits are visited
- GF(3) conservation ensures balanced inquiry
